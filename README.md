# Parking-Lot-Management-system

A Parking Lot Management System is a software solution designed to streamline the management of parking spaces, reservations, and payments within a parking facility. Here’s an overview of the system, its core components, and how it functions, based on the typical features in such a project:

# Key Objectives of the Parking Lot Management System
Automate Parking Operations: Simplify the process of finding and assigning available parking spaces.
Efficient Slot Management: Manage different types of parking slots for various vehicle types.
Payment Handling: Process payments and maintain transaction records.
Error Handling and Security: Minimize user errors and handle exceptions effectively to maintain smooth operations.
Core Features of the System
# Vehicle Type Management:

Differentiates between vehicle types (e.g., Cars, Bikes), each with distinct space requirements.
Uses inheritance and polymorphism by defining a Vehicle superclass and specific subclasses (like Car and Bike).
# Slot Allocation and Tracking:

Finds and assigns the nearest available slot to a vehicle.
Tracks occupied and available slots in real-time using a ParkingSlot class.
Uses Java Collections (like List for available slots and Map for occupied slots) for efficient slot management.
# Reservation and Payment Processing:

Provides functionality for parking reservations and immediate slot allocation.
Includes a Payment inner class to handle payment processing within the main ParkingManager class.
Implements custom exceptions, such as InvalidSlotException for slot-related errors and PaymentException for payment-related issues.
# Concurrency Handling:

Uses Java threading to manage simultaneous parking requests and payment processes.
Ensures that the system can handle multiple users at once without conflicts, making it suitable for high-traffic parking facilities.
# Data Persistence:

Stores transaction records and parking data using file handling to maintain data after the program terminates.
In a future version, data storage could be enhanced by integrating a database system for more scalable and robust data management.
System Architecture
# Class Structure:

ParkingManager: Central class managing the parking facility operations, including slot allocation, payment processing, and slot tracking.

Vehicle: Base class for different vehicle types. The subclasses (Car, Bike) inherit from this class.

ParkingSlot: Represents a single parking slot, with methods to set its status (occupied or available).

Payment (Inner Class): Manages payment-related functionality and transaction records.

Exceptions: Custom exceptions (e.g., InvalidSlotException, PaymentException) for error handling.

Data Handling with Collections and File I/O:

Java’s Map and List are used to manage slot assignments and parked vehicles.

File I/O is employed to save transaction and slot information, allowing for persistent data storage.

## Implementation Concepts
# Object-Oriented Principles:

Uses inheritance (e.g., Vehicle as a parent class) and polymorphism (e.g., common methods overridden in subclasses).

Applies encapsulation by keeping data (like payment details) within inner classes.
# Exception Handling:

Ensures smooth operation by catching specific issues (e.g., invalid slots, payment errors) with custom exceptions.
# Threading for Concurrency:

Java threads manage multiple parking and payment requests, improving efficiency.
# Future Improvements
Database Integration: Using a relational database like MySQL for more robust and secure data storage.

Web/Mobile Application: Extending the system to a mobile or web application for remote access.

Reporting and Analytics: Adding functionality to generate reports on parking usage, revenue, etc., for management insights.
